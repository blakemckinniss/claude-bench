# Claude Code Hook System - Cleanup Complete

## Summary

All technical debt files have been successfully removed. The hook system now adheres to Claude Code's official settings.json format.

## Files Removed

### From .claude/hooks/ directory:
- ✅ optimized_shared_state.py
- ✅ optimized_pattern_detector.py  
- ✅ optimized_memory_manager.py
- ✅ optimized_enforce_claude_md.py
- ✅ hook_manager.py
- ✅ performance_dashboard.py
- ✅ migrate_to_optimized.py

### From project root directory:
- ✅ HOOK_OPTIMIZATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md
- ✅ claude-hooks-performance-analysis.md
- ✅ hook-optimization-examples.py
- ✅ hook-optimization-guide.md
- ✅ hook-performance-test.py

## Current State

### Settings.json
The existing settings.json already follows the official Claude Code format perfectly. No changes were needed.

### Remaining Hook Files
All remaining hooks are compatible with the official format:
- enforce_claude_md.py - Main validation hook
- shared_state.py - Simple JSON-based state
- pattern_detector.py - Basic pattern detection
- additional_context.py - Context provider
- redirect-to-tavily.py - Web redirect
- memory_*_hook.py - Memory system hooks
- performance_monitor_hook.py - Basic monitoring

### Key Points
1. All hooks use simple command strings only
2. No priority, condition, async, or cache_key fields
3. Only official hook events are used
4. All paths use $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR variable

## Conclusion

The hook system is now fully compliant with Claude Code's official documentation. All experimental optimizations that relied on unsupported features have been removed.
