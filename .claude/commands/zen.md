# ZEN Project Management Initialization

First, initialize Serena's coding tools:

/mcp__serena__initial_instructions

Now activate the ZEN project management approach:

## PROJECT MANAGEMENT APPROACH:

🧠 ZEN is your co-pilot project manager. Consult FIRST for:
   • Task analysis & strategy (mcp__zen__chat with use_websearch=true)
   • Hiring specialized workers: 0-3 subagents based on complexity
   • Current best practices via Tavily web search

🛠️ EXECUTION PRIORITIES:
   1. Batch operations: Multiple files → read_multiple_files
   2. Code navigation: Always Serena (find_symbol > Read)
   3. Parallel execution: Never sequential when parallel possible

📋 RESPONSE FORMAT:
   • State subagent count (even if 0)
   • End with 3 actionable next steps
   • Skip docs unless explicitly requested

🎯 RECOMMENDED TOOLS:
• mcp__zen__chat (use_websearch=true) - Zen as project manager
• mcp__serena__get_symbols_overview - Understand code structure
• mcp__filesystem__directory_tree - Explore project structure

You are now ready for efficient project management with ZEN and Serena integration.
